    <h1>What Should  children  Eat?</h1>
    <h2>Btreakfast</h2>
   <p> "Eat your breakfast. It's the most important meal of the day!" Why are parents always saying that?<br>

Well, imagine you're a car. After a long night of sleeping, your fuel tank is empty. Breakfast is the fuel that gets you going so you can hit the road.<br>

What Should I Eat?<br>
Just like with other meals, try to eat a variety of foods, including:<br>

fruit<br>
vegetables<br>
grains ( make at least half your grains whole grains)<br>
protein (meat, poultry, fish, eggs, dry beans, nuts, and seeds)<br>
dairy products (low-fat or fat-free milk, cheese, and yogurt)<br>
Breakfast Ideas<br>
First, the traditional ones:<br>
eggs<br>
French toast, waffles, or pancakes (try wheat or whole-grain varieties)<br>
cold cereal and milk<br>
hot cereal, such as oatmeal or cream of wheat (try some dried fruit or nuts on top)<br>
whole-grain toast, bagel, or English muffin with cheese<br>
yogurt with fruit or nuts<br>
fruit smoothie, such as a strawberry smoothie<br>
And now some weird (but yummy) ones:<br>
banana dog (peanut butter, a banana, and raisins in a long whole-grain bun)<br>
breakfast taco (scrambled eggs and shredded cheese on a tortilla, topped with salsa)<br>
country cottage cheese (apple butter mixed with cottage cheese)<br>
fruit and cream cheese sandwich (use strawberries or other fresh fruit)<br>
sandwich — grilled cheese, peanut butter and jelly, or another favorite<br>
Skipping Breakfast<br>
Some kids skip breakfast because they sleep too late or because they think it's a way to stay thin. But people who skip breakfast tend to eat more calories throughout the day.<br>

If you find yourself skipping breakfast because you're too rushed, try these quick breakfasts. They're easy to grab on the way out the door or get ready the night before:<br>

single servings of whole-grain, low-sugar cereal<br>
yogurt<br>
fresh fruit<br>
whole-grain muffin<br>
trail mix<br>
What Else Should I Know?<br>
Just in case you need more evidence that eating breakfast is the way to go, kids who don't eat breakfast are less able to learn at school, get less iron (an important nutrient) in their diets, and are more likely to have a higher body mass index (BMI), which is a sign they may be overwe.

Almuerzos escolares
More than at other meals, kids have a lot of control over what they eat for lunch at school. A kid can choose to eat the green beans or throw them out. A kid also can choose to eat an apple instead of an ice cream sandwich.
When choosing what to eat for lunch, making a healthy choice is really important. Here's why: Eating a variety of healthy foods gives you energy to do stuff, helps you grow the way you should, and can even keep you from getting sick.

Think of your school lunch as the fuel you put in your tank. If you choose the wrong kind of fuel, you might run out of energy before the day is over.

So what is the right kind of fuel? What does a healthy lunch look like? Unlike that killer question on your math test, there are many right answers to these questions.

To Buy or Not to Buy
Most kids have the choice of packing lunch or buying one at school. The good news is that a kid can get a healthy lunch by doing either one. Read the cafeteria menu the night before. Knowing what's for lunch will let you know if you want to eat it! Bring home a copy of the menu or look for it on the school website.

A packed lunch isn't automatically healthier than one you buy at school. If you pack chocolate cake and potato chips, that's not a nutritious meal! But a packed lunch, if you do it right, does have a clear advantage. When you pack your lunch, you can be sure it includes your favorite healthy foods — stuff you know you like. It's not a one-size-fits-all lunch. It's a lunch just for you. If your favorite sandwich is peanut butter and banana, just make it and pack it — then you can eat it for lunch. Or maybe you love olives. Go ahead and pack them!

If you want to pack your lunch, you'll need some help from your parents. Talk to them about what you like to eat in your lunch so they can stock up on those foods. Parents might offer to pack your lunch for you. This is nice of them, but you may want to watch how they do it and ask if you can start making your lunches yourself. It's a way to show that you're growing up.

10 Steps to a Great Lunch
Whether you pack or buy your lunch, follow these guidelines:

Choose fruits and vegetables. Fruits and vegetables are like hitting the jackpot when it comes to nutrition. They make your plate more colorful and they're packed with vitamins and fiber. It's a good idea to eat at least five servings of fruits and vegetables every day, so try to fit in one or two at lunch. A serving isn't a lot. A serving of carrots is ½ cup or about 6 baby carrots. A fruit serving could be one medium orange.
Know the facts about fat. Kids need some fat in their diets to stay healthy — it also helps keep you feeling full — but you don't want to eat too much of it. Fat is found in butter, oils, cheese, nuts, and meats. Some higher-fat lunch foods include french fries, hot dogs, cheeseburgers, macaroni and cheese, and chicken nuggets. Don't worry if you like these foods! No food is bad, but you may want to eat them less often and in smaller portions. Foods that are lower in fat are usually baked or grilled. Some of the best low-fat foods are fruits, vegetables, and skim and low-fat milk.
Go for whole grains. "Grains" include breads, cereals, rice, and pasta. But as we learn more about good nutrition, it's clear that whole grains are better than refined grains. What's the difference? Brown rice is a whole grain, but white rice is not. Whole-wheat bread contains whole grains, but regular white bread does not.
Sip sensibly. It's not just about what you eat — drinks count too! Milk has been a favorite lunchtime drink for a long time. If you don't like milk, choose water. Avoid juice drinks and sodas.
Balance your lunch. When people talk about balanced meals, they mean meals that include a mix of food groups: some grains, some fruits, some vegetables, some meat or protein foods, and some dairy foods such as milk and cheese. Try to do this with your lunch. If you don't have a variety of foods on your plate, it's probably not balanced. A double order of french fries, for example, would not make for a balanced lunch.
Skip packaged snacks. Many schools make salty snacks, candy, and soda available in the cafeteria or in vending machines. It's OK to have these foods once in a while, but they shouldn't be on your lunch menu.
Mix it up. Do you eat the same lunch every day? If that lunch is a hot dog, it's time to change your routine. Keep your taste buds from getting bored and try something new. Eating lots of different kinds of food gives your body a variety of nutrients.
Quit the clean plate club. Because lunch can be a busy time, you might not stop to think whether you're getting full. Try to listen to what your body is telling you. If you feel full, it's OK to stop eating.
Use your manners. Cafeterias sometimes look like feeding time at the zoo. Don't be an animal! Follow those simple rules your parents are always reminding you about: Chew with your mouth closed. Don't talk and eat at the same time. Use your utensils. Put your napkin on your lap. Be polite. And don't make fun of what someone else is eating.
Don't drink milk and laugh at the same time! Whatever you do at lunch, don't tell your friends a funny joke when they're drinking milk. Before you know it, they'll be laughing and that milk will be coming out their noses! Gross!<br><br>

<h2>Drinks</h2>
What do you, the trees, and a hamster have in common? Give up? You all need water. All living things must have water to survive, whether they get it from a water fountain, a rain cloud, or a little bottle attached to the side of a hamster cage.

Without water, your body would stop working properly. Water makes up more than half of your body weight, and a person can't survive for more than a few days without it. Why? Your body has lots of important jobs and it needs water to do many of them. For instance, your blood, which contains a lot of water, carries oxygen to all the cells of your body. Without oxygen, those tiny cells would die and your body would stop working.

Water is also in lymph (say: limf), a fluid that is part of your immune system, which helps you fight off illness. Water helps keep your temperature normal. You need water to digest your food and get rid of waste. Water is needed for digestive juices, urine (pee), and poop. And you can bet that water is the main ingredient in perspiration, also called sweat.

Besides being an important part of the fluids in your body, water is needed by each cell to work.

Your body doesn't get water only from drinking water. Any fluid you drink will contain water, but water and milk are the best choices. Lots of foods contain water too. Fruit contains quite a bit of water, which you could probably tell if you've ever bitten into a peach or plum and felt the juices dripping down your chin. Vegetables also contain a lot of water — think of slicing into a fat tomato or crunching into a crisp stalk of celery.

How Much Is Enough?
Because water is so important, you might wonder if you're drinking enough. There is no magic amount of water that kids need to drink every day. The amount kids need depends on their age, body size, health, and activity level, plus the weather (temperature and humidity levels).

Usually, kids drink something with meals and should definitely drink when they're thirsty. But if you're sick, or it's warm out or you're exercising, you'll need more. Be sure to drink some extra water when you're out in warm weather, especially while playing sports or exercising.

When you drink is also important. If you're going to sports practice, a game, or just working out or playing hard, drink water before, during, and after playing. Don't forget your water bottle. You can't play your best when you're thinking about how thirsty you are!

When your body doesn't have enough water, that's called being dehydrated. Even mild dehydration can keep you from being as fast and as sharp as you'd like to be. A bad case of dehydration can make you sick. So keep that water bottle handy. Not only does water fight dehydration, but it's refreshing and has no calories.

Your body regulates the amount of water in your system. The body holds on to water when you don't have enough or gets rid of it if you have too much. If your pee is very light yellow, you are well hydrated. When your pee is very dark yellow, it's time to drink up.

You can help your body by drinking before you're thirsty and drinking extra water when you exercise and when it's warm out. Your body will be able to do all its wonderful, waterful jobs and you'll feel great! <br> <br>

<h1>For teen </h1>
Teens are busy, and often skip meals. Even if you eat three meals a day, you may still feel hungry between meals. Either way, it can be tempting to grab something fast, like cookies, chips, and candy. Instead, get a nutrition boost with healthy snacks. Choose fruits, veggies, whole grains, dairy, and protein foods to get the most out of your snacks. 

Eating a healthy snack can help you stay focused, give you energy, and keep hunger in check.

Smart Snacking Strategies
When you want a snack, choose fruits and vegetables, whole grains that have 3 grams of fiber or more, and protein-rich foods, such as peanut butter or low-fat yogurt or cheese. Avoid snacks that are high in sugar, salt, and fat. 

Here are some ways to make healthy snacking part of your everyday routine:

Keep healthy snacks in your refrigerator or pantry. This will make it easier to make the healthy choice when it comes to snacking. 
Make sweets, chips, and other treats the exception rather than the rule. An occasional treat is fine, but choose healthy snacks most of the time.
Have a schedule for meals and snacks. When you graze throughout the day you may not notice when you are hungry or full and eat extra calories. When you skip meals, you are more likely to make poor food choices and overeat when you do eat. 
Practice mindful eating. Eat all snacks and meals at the table. Don't watch TV, play video games, or be on your phone when you are eating
Read the nutrition facts label when buying packaged snacks. Look for snacks that are low in added sugar and high in nutrients, like fiber, protein, and calcium. Check the serving size, especially when eating typical snack foods, like chips. What looks like a small package may be 2 or more servings — which means double or even triple the amounts of fat, calories, and sugar shown on the label
Bring healthy snacks with you. Make it a habit to stash some fruit, nuts, whole-grain crackers, or baby carrots in your backpack or workout bag so you have a healthy snack when you need it.
What Are Some Healthy Snacks?
Here are a few healthy snacking ideas:

Smoothies: Blend fresh or frozen fruit or veggies, like kale or spinach, with yogurt, milk, or a dairy-free milk option. Add a tablespoon of peanut butter or almond butter for extra protein.
Whole-grain pita, veggies, and hummus: Toast a pita, then cut it into triangles. Serve with cut-up veggies and your favorite hummus.
Homemade trail mix: Combine 1 cup whole-grain toasted oat cereal with ¼ cup chopped walnuts and ¼ cup dried cranberries for a healthy trail mix.
Air-popped or lite popcorn: Spice up your popcorn by sprinkling it with parmesan cheese or other seasonings, like chili powder or lemon pepper.
Banana “ice cream”: Peel several ripe bananas, break them into 1-inch pieces, and freeze them in a sealed plastic bag. Just before serving, whirl the pieces in the blender with a small amount of water or milk. Add berries for a different flavor or top with fruit or nuts.
